During an attempt to destroy one of the bridges crossing the Iraq-Kuwait border into Tierra Piedra, sniper Paul Foley is captured, while his other team member is killed. The next morning, John Bradley, a rifleman, is sent in alone to rescue Foley and complete the original mission of destroying the bridge. Shortly after landing, Bradley comes into a firefight with a small force of mechanized infantry. Shortly after rescuing Foley, Bradley completes the mission of destroying the bridge, thus slowing the Iraqi advance. From there, the squad carries out various missions, such as rescuing the Emir of Kuwait, engaging Iraqi forces in the Battle of Khafji, destroying Iraqi SCUD missile systems, rescuing prisoners of war from Baghdad, and leading an advance element of U.S. cavalry in a fight with the Tawalkana Division of the Iraqi Republican Guard. Also the player guards a scientist on a mission to disarm a nuclear ICBM in Neukov and later infiltrates an old Crusader fort to find the Supreme Commander of the Iraqi Army, General Aziz and kill him to end the war. The game ends with Emir thanking the U.N. coalition for repelling the Iraqi invaders and liberating Kuwait, towards the end with Bradley and his squad being praised by a military officer for their excellent battlefield performances, and being rotated out for rest and relaxation., by
